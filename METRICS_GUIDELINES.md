# Metrics & Statistics Guidelines
## Credible, Verifiable Claims for Zero Barriers Website

## ❌ DO NOT USE - Unrealistic Claims

**Avoid these types of claims:**
- "150% average growth in 90 days" - **Absurd and unverifiable**
- "Average growth" without context or attribution
- Time-bound claims that can't be proven
- Metrics without specific client attribution
- One-size-fits-all promises (e.g., "all clients achieve X%")

**Why this matters:**
- **Every client is different** - Results vary by industry, company size, starting point, and execution
- Damages credibility and trust
- Can create legal/ethical issues if questioned
- Makes the business look dishonest
- Visitors will immediately discount the claim

## 📊 Recommended Metrics for Hero Section

Instead of:
```
❌ 150% Average Growth
❌ 90 Days to Results
❌ 200+ Businesses
```

Use:
```
✅ 122% Peak Growth (SOS Support)

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always Attribute:** Link metrics to specific case studies
2. **Use Ranges:** "25-122%" is more credible than "150% average" (recognizes client diversity)
3. **Show Real Examples:** "See how SOS Support achieved 122% growth"
4. **Be Conservative:** Under-promise, over-deliver
5. **Time Context:** If using timeframes, be specific: "122% growth in first year" not "in 90 days"
6. **Emphasize Individuality:** "Every client is different. Results vary based on industry, starting point, and execution."
7. **Show Industry Diversity:** Highlight experience across multiple industries (see Industries section below)
