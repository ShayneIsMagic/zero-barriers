# Hero Section Layout Options
## Ways to display text without obscuring the hero image

### Option 1: Split Screen Layout (Text Left / Image Right)
- Text content on the left (50% width)
- Image on the right (50% width)
- Clean separation, both fully visible

### Option 2: Text in Sidebar/Strip
- Image takes most of the space (70-80%)
- Text in a sidebar/vertical strip on one side
- Can have subtle background for readability

### Option 3: Text Below Image
- Full-width image at top
- Text content below
- Both fully visible, classic layout

### Option 4: Text in Corner Panel
- Text positioned in a corner with organic shape background
- Image visible in most of the space
- Panel has subtle transparency/gradient

### Option 5: Text Wrapping Around Image
- Image centered/positioned
- Text flows around it in organic shapes
- More dynamic, creative layout

### Option 6: Text in Bottom Strip/Bar
- Full-width image above
- Text in a bottom bar/strip overlay
- Only slight overlay at bottom edge
