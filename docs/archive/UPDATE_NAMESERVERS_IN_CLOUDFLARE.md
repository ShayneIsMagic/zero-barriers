# Update Nameservers in Cloudflare Dashboard

## Steps to Update Nameservers in Cloudflare

### 1. Go to Your Domain in Cloudflare

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click **"Websites"** in left sidebar
3. Click on **zerobarriers.io**

### 2. Find Nameservers Section

Look for one of these:

**Option A: Overview Page**
- On the Overview page, you should see a section about nameservers
- It might show: "Replace your current nameservers with Cloudflare nameservers"
- Click **"Continue"** or **"Update Nameservers"** button if visible

**Option B: DNS Tab**
- Click **"DNS"** tab at the top
- Look for nameserver information at the top or in a banner
- There might be a button to update nameservers

**Option C: Domain Settings**
- Look for **"Overview"** tab or **"Quick Actions"**
- There should be information about nameservers
- Cloudflare might have an option to "Auto-update" or show instructions

### 3. Cloudflare's Instructions

Cloudflare should show you:
- Current nameservers (the old ones: kiki, yoxall)
- New nameservers to use (haley, peyton)
- A button or link to update them

**If Cloudflare has a direct update option:**
- Click it and follow the prompts
- Cloudflare will attempt to update nameservers at your registrar

**If Cloudflare only shows instructions:**
- It means you need to update at GoDaddy (registrar level)
- But at least you'll see exactly what to do
