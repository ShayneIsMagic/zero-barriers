# ⚠️ You're in the Wrong Place - Go to Domain Settings

## Current Location ❌

You're currently in:
- **Workers & Pages** → **zero-barriers** → **Settings**

This is for **Pages project configuration** (build settings, environment variables, etc.)

---

## Where You Need to Go ✅

The Security Level is in the **DOMAIN settings**, not the Pages project settings.

### Correct Path:

1. **Go back to main Cloudflare Dashboard:**
   - Click **"Websites"** in the left sidebar (or click Cloudflare logo to go home)

2. **Click on your domain:**
   - Click **zerobarriers.io** (the domain, not the Pages project)

3. **Go to Security:**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Security"**

4. **Go to Settings:**
   - Click **"Settings"** (under Security section)

5. **Find Security Level:**
   - Scroll down to find **"Security Level"** dropdown
   - Change it to **"Medium"**
   - Save

## Visual Guide

```
❌ WRONG PATH (where you are now):
Cloudflare Dashboard
  └── Workers & Pages
       └── zero-barriers (Pages project)
            └── Settings (Build, Variables, etc.)

✅ CORRECT PATH (where you need to go):
Cloudflare Dashboard
  └── Websites
       └── zerobarriers.io (THE DOMAIN - click this!)
            └── Security (left sidebar)
                 └── Settings
                      └── Security Level (change to "Medium")
```

---

## Quick Steps

1. **Click "Websites"** in left sidebar (top of navigation)
2. **Click "zerobarriers.io"** (the domain name, not the Pages project)
3. **Click "Security"** in left sidebar
4. **Click "Settings"**
5. **Find "Security Level"** and change to **"Medium"**
6. **Save**

---

## Difference

- **Pages Project Settings** (where you are): Build config, environment variables, deployment settings
- **Domain Settings** (where you need to go): Security Level, WAF, DNS, SSL/TLS

The Security Level affects the **domain** (zerobarriers.io), not the Pages project, so it's in domain settings.

**Navigate to: Websites → zerobarriers.io → Security → Settings → Security Level**
