## Deployment Notes

### For Static Export (Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages)
The site is configured with `output: 'export'` which generates static files in the `out/` directory.

### Important Files to Commit
- ✅ All source code
- ✅ `env.template` (template, not actual keys)
- ❌ `.env.local` (should NOT be committed - already in .gitignore)

### Files Generated (Auto-generated, don't commit manually)
- `out/` directory (generated by build)
- `.next/` directory (generated by build)

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing checklist above
2. Commit all changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Configure deployment with environment variables
