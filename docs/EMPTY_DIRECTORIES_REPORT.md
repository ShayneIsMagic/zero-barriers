# Empty Directories Report

## Summary
This report identifies empty directories in the project and whether they're needed.

---

## üî¥ Empty Directories Found

### 1. SCSS Structure Folders (Not Used)
These directories were likely created for an SCSS modular structure, but all styles are in `globals.css`:

```
src/styles/layout/          - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/components/      - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/abstracts/       - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/media-queries/  - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/pages/           - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/themes/          - Empty (not needed)
src/styles/base/            - Empty (not needed)
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Safe to remove
**Reason**: Next.js build uses single `globals.css` file, not SCSS modules

---

### 2. Public Icons Directory
```
public/icons/               - Empty
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep for future use OR remove
**Reason**: May be needed for favicons/icons later, but currently empty

---

## ‚úÖ Files Status

- **No empty files found** ‚úÖ
- All code files contain content
- No placeholder files detected

---

## üßπ Cleanup Recommendation

### Safe to Remove (SCSS Structure):
```bash
rmdir src/styles/layout
rmdir src/styles/components
rmdir src/styles/abstracts
rmdir src/styles/media-queries
rmdir src/styles/pages
rmdir src/styles/themes
rmdir src/styles/base
```

### Optional (Icons Directory):
```bash
# Option 1: Keep for future use (recommended)
# Leave public/icons/ empty - it may be needed for favicons

# Option 2: Remove if not planning to use
rmdir public/icons
```

## üìä Impact

**Removing empty directories:**
- Reduces project clutter
- No impact on build (directories aren't referenced)
- Improves project structure clarity

**Safe removal:** All empty directories are safe to remove without affecting the build.
