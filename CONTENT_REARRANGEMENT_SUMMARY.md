## 🔄 Key Content Changes

### 1. Hero Section

**Changes:**
- **Eyebrow:** Changed from "Purpose-Driven Growth Agency" → "POTENTIAL UNLEASHED"
- **Headline:** Enhanced with line break: "Transform Your<br />Revenue Growth"
- **Subheadline:** Simplified to "Rapid. Substantial. Sustainable." (three powerful words)

- **CTA Buttons:** 
  - "Get Started Today" → "Begin Your Transformation"
  - "View Case Studies" → "See Transformations"
- **Metrics Removed:** Extracted from hero to standalone Stats Section (see below)

**Rationale:** Transformation-focused messaging that emphasizes what the client becomes, not just what services are offered.

### 2. Value Proposition Section (NEW)

We don't just consult—we transform. Our proven four-phase methodology combines deep expertise with innovative strategies to eliminate revenue barriers and unleash your business potential.

Proof Badges:
- Proven Methodology

- Sustainable Growth
```

**Purpose:** Establishes credibility immediately after hero, positioning Zero Barriers as transformation experts.

### 3. Stats Section (NEW)

**Extracted from Hero, Updated with Verifiable Metrics:**

**Before (unrealistic):**
- 150% Average Revenue Growth
- 90 Days to Results
- 200+ Businesses Transformed

**After (verifiable):**
- 122% Peak Growth Achieved (SOS Support case study)
- 25-122% Revenue Growth Range (across documented case studies)

- **Content:** Slightly adjusted to lead with client achievements ("We achieved...", "We grew...")
- **Repositioned:** Moved before Technology (clients-as-hero comes before tools)

### 6. Technology Section

**Changes:**
- **Repositioned:** Moved after Testimonials (tools come after proof)
- **Content:** Kept existing content (already well-positioned)
- **Added Context:** Positions as "Enablers of transformation" in section comment

**Rationale:** Technology supports transformation; testimonials prove it works.

### 7. FAQ Section

**Changes:**
