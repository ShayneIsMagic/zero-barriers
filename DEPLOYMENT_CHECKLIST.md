# Zero Barriers - Deployment Checklist

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Version Lock & Stability

### Package Version Lock
- ✅ All packages locked to exact versions (no ^ or ~ ranges)
- ✅ Next.js: 15.5.0 (LTS)
- ✅ React: 19.1.0 (Stable)
- ✅ TypeScript: 5.6.3 (Stable)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS: 4.1.12 (Latest Stable)

### Update Process (REQUIRED)
1. **NEVER** run `npm update` without testing
2. **NEVER** change package versions without thorough testing
3. **ALWAYS** test in development environment first
4. **ALWAYS** run full build and test suite before deployment
5. **ALWAYS** backup current working version before updates

## 🔒 Stability Measures

### NPM Configuration
- ✅ save-exact=true (prevents automatic version bumps)
- ✅ package-lock=true (ensures consistent installs)
- ✅ audit=false (prevents security update prompts)

### Version Control
- ✅ All dependencies locked to specific versions
- ✅ package-lock.json committed to repository
- ✅ .npmrc configured for stability

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Before Any Update
1. **Build Test**: `npm run build` must pass
2. **Lint Test**: `npm run lint` must pass
3. **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation must pass
4. **Visual Test**: All pages must render correctly
5. **Performance Test**: Lighthouse score must remain >90

### After Any Update
1. **Functionality Test**: All features must work
2. **Responsive Test**: All breakpoints must work
3. **SEO Test**: Meta tags and structure must be preserved
4. **Performance Test**: Load times must not degrade
5. **Cross-browser Test**: Must work in major browsers
